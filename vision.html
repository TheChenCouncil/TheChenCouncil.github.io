                country grapples with converging crises. This will include actions to control the COVID-19 pandemic,
                provide economic relief, tackle climate change, and advance racial equity and civil rights, as well as
                immediate actions to reform our immigration system and restore America’s standing in the world.</p>

                    safely reopening schools and businesses, and taking science-driven steps to address the communities
                    — especially communities of color — who have been hardest hit by this virus. And, President Louw
                    will launch a national vaccination program to inoculate the U.S. population efficiently and
                    equitably.</p>

                    demands of science, the President is mobilizing a whole-of-government effort to reduce climate
                    pollution in every sector of the economy and increase resilience to climate impacts. The Louw

                    deliver an equitable clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero
                    emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050.</p>

                <p class="mb-3 ">The promise of our nation is that every American has an equal chance to get ahead, yet
                    persistent systemic racism and barriers to opportunity have denied this promise for so many.
                    President Louws putting equity at the center of the agenda with a whole of government approach to
                    embed racial justice across Federal agencies, policies, and programs. And President Louw will take
                    bold action to advance a comprehensive equity agenda to deliver criminal justice reform, end
                    disparities in healthcare access and education, strengthen fair housing, and restore Federal respect
                    for Tribal sovereignty, among other actions, so that everyone across America has the opportunity to

                    provide relief to those who are struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The President will also
                    work with Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan to change the course of the pandemic, build a
                    bridge towards economic recovery, and invest in racial justice. And, he will build our economy back

                    Louw’s strategy is centered on the basic premise that our country is safer, stronger, and more
                    prosperous with a fair and orderly immigration system that welcomes immigrants, keeps families
                    together, and allows people across the country—both newly arrived immigrants and people who have
