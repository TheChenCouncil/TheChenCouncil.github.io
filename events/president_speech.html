                upholding rigorous standards of fiscal responsibility and transparency in public finance. These

                <p class="mb-6 " style="text-indent: 3em;">Hello and good morning fellow classmates, and friends. It is
                    with
                    great honor and merriment
                    that I stand here talking before you today. I am delighted to have the opportunity here before you
                    to
                    lay out my team's plans for how we will improve on this great country. Make no mistake this was no
                    feat
                    I could achieve by myself. It took the combination of some of the greatest minds we know to develop
                    such
                    a plan for this country.</p>

                <p class="mb-6 " style="text-indent: 3em;">Firstly, I would like to expand on what my colleague stated
                    earlier about immigration as well as housing. We are by no means against immigration. We know
                    Canada's
                    historic importance and value as a safe country for those looking for a safe place to immigrate to.
                    However, I would like to point your attention towards Canada’s current housing status. What point is
                    there in immigrating to a country that physically cannot support you or your family. We value the
                    safety
                    and well being of all our immigrants and if we continue expanding our immigration policies at this
                    rate,
                    the housing status will not improve. This not only affects our immigrants but also hinders our own
                    citizens from staying in Canada, as future generations have no chance in this continually growing
                    housing economy. But I can assure you that my team is doing their utmost best to analyze all
                    possible
                    ways to maintain immigration levels while allowing for our housing situation to improve.</p>

                <p class="mb-6 " style="text-indent: 3em;">Secondly, I would like to point out that our country's
                    current
                    government has poured countless millions of dollars into hundreds of public services over the past
                    few
                    years. Each unrestricted grant is dragging our nation more and more in debt. I along with the Louw
                    Party
                    have spent countless hours and weeks discussing this issue alone. As part of our effort to improve
                    this
                    country we have decided to move in the direction of privatized medical healthcare. This involves the
                    privatization of doctors and hospitals, allowing such medical offices to afford the best
                    technologies
                    rather than having the government fund them while they themselves are slowly struggling to cover
                    necessary costs in each hospital. In addition to this we, as a government, would be able to greatly
                    decrease the medical taxes on our citizens, lifting weight off of your shoulders.</p>

                <p class="mb-6 " style="text-indent: 3em;">You may have noticed that a large part of our goals to
                    improve
                    Canada have included ways to improve our federal spending deficit. A problem, of which most parties
                    are
                    not making an effort to improve. Ever since our governments over spending under current control
                    during
                    covid we have been struggling to recover the finances spent during this time. This affects our
                    currency
                    and credit around the world, in turn costing us more within global trade and commerce. Part of the
                    reason for this is due to other parties pushing for more and more government control over you and
                    your
                    money. This is why me and my party are dedicated to removing as much governmental restraint over
                    your
                    lives as ethically, morally, and socially possible to allow YOU the freedom to live your life.</p>

                <p class="mb-6 " style="text-indent: 3em;">The Final topic I will be addressing is the delicate and
                    difficult topic of freedom of expression. Often we are told that we have freedom of speech and the
                    freedom to practice our beliefs and values, UNTIL it goes against what our government likes. As
                    prime
                    minister I would be able to assure you that you will have the freedom to express your beliefs and
                    thoughts without getting cancelled or fully suppressed by the government. Therefore doing away with
                    restrictive laws against freedom of expression… Of course this would not include those related to
                    and
                    about propaganda, indecency, and treason. </p>

                <p class="mb-6 " style="text-indent: 3em;">If there is one thing I could leave you with it would be
                    this. It
                    is a brilliant quote by Lord Acton, a British historian of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
                    centuries. It goes like this, “All power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”
                    Which is why our goal is to reduce power and temptation to allow for a more clear minded and morally
                    accurate government.</p>
